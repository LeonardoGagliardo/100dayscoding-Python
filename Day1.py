#Day 1 Project: Band Name Generator


print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")
print("What's your favorite thing in the whole world (in one word?)")
first_name = input()
print("What makes your heart race? (in one word)")
second_name = input()
print("Your band name could be " + first_name + " " + second_name)




#Another solution:

#print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")
#first_name = input("What's your favorite thing in the whole world (in one word?)\n")

#second_name = input("What makes your heart race? (in one word)\n")

#print("Your band name could be " + first_name + " " + second_name)
